Imagining ourselves in world that is a video game, because just like life, video games are hard. 
We spawn in, next to a bed. Confused, scared, anxious if we are going to fit into the class or not. 
Perhaps the subject material is difficult, and a little outside help is needed. 
Reaching out to others, you find that many of your peers have their own groups already. 
In fact this is not the first time this has occured. 
If only their was an app to help you with making friends in classes.


Luckily, now you do.
With our app "Spawn Point" developed by Ishan Singh and Steven Chang, we aim to tackle this problem of breaking the ice with others. Using the app, you can find your classes, find classmates in your class, and add them! Similar to social media, this app gives you the freedom and initiative to connect and network with others that might otherwise feel difficult to approach. Entering a classroom no longer feels like ruthless video game, spawning you into a wild jungle and left to fend for yourself.


"RESPAWN AND REACH OUT!"


With these words of wisdom, we ask you to unite with your fellow college students this quarter through Spawn Point. While taking courses side by side in this academic journey, you'll find people to study last minute with, to fail midterms with, and to stick with long after graduation and growing up.
